# Mercedes_Benz_Base_Solution_LR_V1
 Kaggle Competition of Mercedes Benz Greener Solution

Overview:
Daimlerâ€™s Mercedes-Benz conducted a competition in 2017 in which they wanted the data scientists across the Kaggle to participate and reduce the testing time by giving them the challenge to tackle the curse of dimensionality and reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench. In this competition, the participants will work with a dataset representing different permutations of Mercedes-Benz car features to predict the time it takes to pass testing.
